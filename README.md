## 🚀 Execution

You can run each class independently based on the exercise you want to test. For example:

- `AlphabeticalOrderDirectory.java` → Exercise 1  
- `RecursiveDirectoryTree.java` → Exercise 2  
- `DirectoryToTextFile.java` → Exercise 3  
- `ReadTextFile.java` → Exercise 4  
- `SerializeCountriesFromFile.java` and `DeserializeCountries.java` → Exercise 5
